      <description>As developed countries head for booster shots, a rising concern on the inequality of COVID-19 vaccines distributions is coming to surface. Is this concern, however, exaggerated?
  Well… It’s not. As Portugal nears 75% of full vaccination rates on its population, there are still countries not reaching 1%. Perhaps unsurprisingly, African countries rate among the worse, as only 3% of the continent’s population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
Issues of morality The World Health Organization has already caught up on this issue, with its head Tedros Ghebreyesus stating that it&amp;rsquo;s unacceptable that countries which have used most of the global supply of vaccines keep using even more of it.</description>
