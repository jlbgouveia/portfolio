      <description>The Project: By late 2020, a close friend of mine asked for help implementing a trading strategy he had thought of. I eagerly accepted the challenge. I can’t say, however, that I expected it to be extremely profitable. His idea was so simple, it was difficult to believe that it would fare well in a market filled with sophisticated trading algorithms. But, well.. it turned out to do just that.</description>

      <description>Motivation: Have you ever had the curiosity to understand how Donald Trump’s election affected the US’ stock market? More specifically, have you ever wondered how it impacted environmentally responsible and carbon-intensive firms?
My thesis focused on answering such questions. The stock market reactions to the below three events were studied:
• Donald Trump’s election in 2016
• The nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency
• The Withdrawal of the U.</description>

      <description>Motivation: What are the prospects of investing in Suriname for an international investor? How has the development of prices and exchange rates been in this country? And how can we predict its development? Understanding Suriname’s economic outlook and development is the main goal of the project. This country’s economy, however, is highly dependent on gold and oil price shifts, so understanding the development of these commodities prices could give us insights on the prior.</description>

      <title>Event Study Framework</title>
      <link>https://jlbgouveia.github.io/jose_portfolio/post/project-2_eventstudy/</link>

      <guid>https://jlbgouveia.github.io/jose_portfolio/post/project-2_eventstudy/</guid>
      <description>Motivation: Oftentimes, certain extremely unexpected events can&amp;rsquo;t but shake a market as it is: Brexit, the Panama papers release, Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s election in 2016, to name a few&amp;hellip; How can we study the impact of such events on the valuation of firms directly involved in these situations?
In this notebook, I aim to present a guide on how to perform an event study, using Python. More specifically, I provide a framework on how to compute Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) adjusted returns, which is a measure widely used academically to perform such studies.</description>

      <description>Motivation: For a general use, if you want to keep track of information on a website that you have an account on, and periodically receive an email with an excel file with that same information, then this notebook should serve as the basis to do that job.
The Process: In this project in particular, I use Python to automate the following actions:
• Going to the Magic Formula Investing Website, and perform a login with my account</description>
